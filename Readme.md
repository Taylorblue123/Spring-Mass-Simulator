# Spring-Mass Simulator

## Summary

The Spring-Mass Simulator is implemented in MSVC 2022 C++. We divide the simulation calculations and rendering into two parts. The physical modeling and numerical calculations are written in C++ (using the Euler Method, Midpoint Method, and RK4 Method). The rendering module relies on the OpenGL API along with GLFW, GLM, GLAD, and ImGui libraries. To build the executable, the user needs to download all the required libraries and link them in their MSVC environment.

## Problem One: Spring-Mass Simulator

Similarly, there is also a UI panel that allows the user to adjust various parameters of our entire spring model. To better simulate the actual motion of a spring, we model the large spring as being composed of many small springs connected between nodes. At each time step, we iterate over all sub-springs, calculate the updated spring and damping forces, and then apply them to the connected particles. Next, we iterate over all particles to update their acceleration and states. There are also different numerical integration methods to choose from.

## Features

- Use the UI panel to input parameters and press "Fire" to start the simulation
- Select different numerical integration methods
- Press Esc to release mouse camera control to interact with the panel; press Esc again to regain camera control
- Use WSAD keys to navigate within the world

## Build Steps

1. Download and install MSVC 2022
2. Download and link the following libraries:
   - OpenGL
   - GLFW
   - GLM
   - GLAD
   - ImGui
3. Configure the project in the MSVC environment and build

## Controls

- **Esc**: Release/regain mouse camera control
- **WSAD**: Navigate within the world
